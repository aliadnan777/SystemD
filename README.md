* systemd is a suite of system management daemons, libraries, and utilities designed as a central management and configuration platform for the Linux computer operating system
* Systemd provides a standard process for controlling what programs run when a Linux system boots up
* systemd is a replacement for the old SysV init system.
* The init system is the software that initializes your system. When you boot up, init is responsible for loading the appropriate drivers, activating your network connection, launching various system services, and finally bringing up the graphical login screen where you log in. 
* SysV init is an old system that basically just runs scripts located under /etc/init.d.
